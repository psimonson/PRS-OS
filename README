Very simple Operating System using C/ASM. It is NOT a
full OS, it may never be it's just a hobby OS.
Currently only boots from a floppy disk drive but,
maybe later I'll add support for LBA (Logical Block
Addressing). Which LBA is used for flash drives and
hard disks. Current commands include, help, hello,
play, play music, search, reset_CMOS(#1), reboot,
dump(#2), exec(#3), ls(#3), exit.
======================================================
NOTES:
	(#1) - Award BIOS only, RISKY to use on other
	machines. Would not recommend it.

	(#2) - Dumps either boot sector or CMOS to the
	screen.

	(#3) - Not yet implemented. Currently working
	on it though.

don't clone/copy and/or modify. Then, put it as your

give me credit.

NOTE: The reason I've decided to make a simple 16-bit
OS (Operating System), is because I thought it might
be a challenge. It most definitely is, but it's making
me a better programmer for doing so. Which I would
like to be the best I can possibly be. Also, this IS
an "AS-IS" project without a WARRANTY. I will NOT be
responsible for any damage to a computer system. As
it may not work correctly on all machines although,
I tried to make it work for many. Which is why I did
not compile for NATIVE mode, it's compiled for a
Generic processor.

Thanks,
